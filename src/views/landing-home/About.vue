            <p class="margin-15">With our many years of experience in inspection service industry we know that convenient and simple way of working is long overdue. And that’s why we designed Qapin - to be a one-stop shop for Inspectors, clients and inspection agencies. </p>
            <!-- <h4 class="h5-style qapin-rza margin-15">Our mission to create economic opportunities so people have better
                lives has taken us so much further. As a result, we’ve become the world’s work marketplace where every
                day businesses of all sizes and independent talent from around the globe meet here to accomplish
                incredible things.</h4> -->
            <p class="margin-15">Our revolutionary platform leads the way in industry offering a completely new approach to connecting those who are offering inspector services and those who need them. </p>
            <p class="margin-15">We have the expertise to understand what’s needed from both sides, and that’s why Qapin was created. </p>

            <p class="text-primary-500"><strong>Budget effectively</strong></p>
            <p class="margin-15">For clients sourcing inspectors, it can be difficult to compare quotes. Finding the inspectors with the right skills and certification who are also available on the required schedules can be time-consuming so often it’s a case of just booking the first one you find.  </p>
            <p class="margin-15">With Qapin there’s the opportunity to have a greater choice, with the ability to filter out the results that match your own criteria. Compare quotes, experience and narrow down the shortlist until you find an inspection service provider you want. </p>
            <p class="margin-15">It’s great for your budget and you’re guaranteed to get someone of the highest skills and experience. We’ve got a secure escrow system too, so the whole transaction is safe from start to finish. </p>

            <p class="text-primary-500"><strong>Find clients</strong></p>
            <p class="margin-15">We’ve created Qapin to be a marketplace that’s dedicated solely to inspection services. That means that you won’t have to scroll through lots of irrelevant projects to find those which match your skills. </p>
           <p class="margin-15">Our filter tool enables you to only see the projects you’re qualified for, and those available in your area. It’s the smart way to search for work and will save you time, while earning you more money!</p>
           
            <p class="text-primary-500"><strong>Ensuring quality</strong></p>
            <p class="margin-15">When you need a contractor engineer for inspection services, it can be a challenge to find a suitably qualified individual who’s available at short notice. Qapin solves the problem by allowing freelancers to manage their profile visibility when available to take up projects and showing prospective clients when they have availability. 
            </p>
            <p class="margin-15">It’s now simple to book in slots at short notice as both parties can see where there’s availability. Freelancers can choose their own working slots, so it’s a solution that’s completely customized. </p>
            <p class="margin-15">Like any industry, price is always a factor but that shouldn’t mean compromising on quality. By chosing a qualified inspector who’s local, the lower travel costs can lead to significant savings. </p>
            <p class="margin-15">Qapin has been deliberately designed as a platform to provide all the necessary options to create a marketplace that works for everyone. Our secure escrow payment system means there is protection for both clients and freelancers and makes it possible to take international jobs without any worries.  </p>
